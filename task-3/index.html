            <h3>F1 - A masterpiece</h3>
            <p>An F1 car is a masterpiece of engineering — a symphony of carbon fiber, aerodynamics, and raw power.
                Weighing less than a compact car but packing over 1,000 horsepower, it's designed for one thing: speed.
                Every curve, every vent, every inch is crafted to slice through air like a scalpel. The tires stick to
                the tarmac like glue, while the engine screams at 15,000 RPM, pushing the limits of physics. It's not
                just a car — it's a rocket with wheels, piloted by the world's best drivers, dancing on the edge of
                control at 300 km/h.</p>
